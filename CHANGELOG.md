* Fix error 500 on old mitreId user interface https://github.com/indigo-iam/iam/pull/808

### Configuration Fixes

* Prefix all necessary env variables with IAM_ https://github.com/indigo-iam/iam/pull/807
    * As described into #807, the environment variables `DEFAULT_ACCESS_TOKEN_VALIDITY_SECONDS`, `DEFAULT_DEVICE_CODE_VALIDITY_SECONDS`, `DEFAULT_ID_TOKEN_VALIDITY_SECONDS` and `DEFAULT_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY_SECONDS` have been renamed with `IAM_` prefix.

### Notes

SCIM users response can now be extended in order to list also:
- user's attributes
- user's authorities
- user's managed groups

In order to include authorities and|or managed groups into SCIM users details you need to enable them through the following properties:

```
scim:
  include_authorities: true

```
or through the environment variables:

```
IAM_SCIM_INCLUDE_AUTHORITIES=true
IAM_SCIM_INCLUDE_MANAGED_GROUPS=true

Attributes can be included into SCIM user response in the same way the labels are:

```
scim.include_attributes[0].name=attribute-name
scim.include_attributes[1].name=another-attribute-name
```

## 1.8.3 (2023-10-30)

### Recommendations
It is **strongly** recommended to **make a backup of your database** before upgrading to v1.8.3 because several migrations are planned. Also, remember that for updates from versions prior to v1.7.2 you **must** first upgrade to v1.7.2.
The migration to v1.8.3 will take an amount of time which will be proportional to the amount of currently active access tokens. This means that if you are deploying IAM with some kind of liveness and readiness probes, it's probably better to **switch them off** before upgrading. This migration may take a long **time.**

### Changed

  certains conditions has been fixed (#397)

- Token exchange is no longer allowed for single-client exchanges that involve
  the `offline_access` scope (#392)
